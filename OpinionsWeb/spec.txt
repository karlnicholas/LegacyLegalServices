[P vs. O.J. Simpson]               Feb-12                           FILENAME
   - Penal Code:27
      10  §1170.78 Initial Sentencing
      14 §§485-464 Burglary
       3  §490a    Larceny
     Welfare and Institutions Code:2
       2  §602     Wards--Jurisdiction
   + P vs. Kidman (3 Cal.3d 729), P. vs. Black (5 Cal. 100), 
   - Affirmed: The court finds that there are many things to be considered
     because it has thought about it a lot. That's our job, and we like 
     to do it at least 10 or 15 times a week. This week has been particularly 
     exciting. People that look like us have been on television, and we were
     watching those people pretend to be us. For this reason we affirm 
     the lower court's findings.
